# Your next Add to Calendar Button

The convenient JavaScript Web Component, which lets you reliably create beautiful buttons, where people can add events to their calendars.

[![#1 Product of the Day on ProductHunt](https://api.producthunt.com/widgets/embed-image/v1/top-post-badge.svg?post_id=319458&theme=dark&period=daily)](https://www.producthunt.com/products/add-to-calendar-button-generator)

<br /><br />

For everybody, who wants to include a button at their website or app, which enables users to easily add a specific event to their calendars.
It's main goal is to keep this process as easy as possible at maximum compatibility. Simply define your button configuration and everything else is automatically generated by the script.
Supporting calendars at Apple, Google, Microsoft (365, Outlook, Teams), Yahoo, and generic iCal.

![Supported Calendars: Apple (via iCal), Google, Microsoft (365, Outlook, Teams), Yahoo, generic iCal](https://github.com/add2cal/add-to-calendar-button/blob/main/assets/img/badge-supported-calendars.svg)

The script, since it is a web component, integrates easily with any usual HTML webpage (**VanillaJS** way) as well as popular JavaScript frameworks and libraries like **Angular**, **React**, **Vue**, **Svelte**, and more.

![Supported Technology: Angular, React, Vue, Svelte, and every other project that can load JavaScript](https://github.com/add2cal/add-to-calendar-button/blob/main/assets/img/badge-technology.svg)

Works with **all modern browsers** (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) on **Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS** as well as rather restricted webview environments like the **Instagram** in-app browser.

## üì¶ Installation / Setup

### Option 1: simple (CDN)

You can use the jsDelivr CDN and load the respective script directly into your website.

Place the script tag inside the `<head>` section.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/add-to-calendar-button@2" async defer></script>
```

<br />

### Option 2: npm

Install the package using the following npm command:

```sh
npm install add-to-calendar-button
```

Import the module into your project/component

```javascript
import 'add-to-calendar-button';
```

Based on your framework/library, you might need to make minor adjustments to the respective config.

Find detailed installation guides for the most common ones, like React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, or Astro at [add-to-calendar-button.com/#installation](https://add-to-calendar-button.com/#installation).

<br />

<br />

## üéõÔ∏è Configuration

A button can be easily created by using the respective custom element.

```html
<add-to-calendar-button></add-to-calendar-button>
<!-- OR simply ... -->
<add-to-calendar-button />
```

You can then configure the button by simply adding the options as attributes to it. Boolean values (true/false) can be set as `optionName="true"` or simply by adding `optionName` to the tag. Not setting it at all would be automatically translate to "false".

<br />

### Structure (PRO)

```html
<add-to-calendar-button proKey="prokey-of-your-event" />
```

<br />

### Minimal structure (no PRO)

Mind that for auto-generating rich snippets, a location would be mandatory as well.

Calendar type options and time zone information are not required, but recommended.

```html
<add-to-calendar-button
  name="Add the title of your event"
  startDate="2022-02-21"
  options="['Google']"
  timeZone="America/Los_Angeles"
/>
```

<br />

### A more powerful example (no PRO)

```html
<add-to-calendar-button
  name="Add the title of your event"
  description="A nice description does not hurt"
  startDate="2022-02-21"
  endDate="2022-03-24"
  startTime="10:13"
  endTime="17:57"
  location="Somewhere over the rainbow"
  options="['Apple','Google','iCal','Microsoft365','Outlook.com','Yahoo']"
  timeZone="Europe/Berlin"
  trigger="click"
  inline
  listStyle="modal"
  iCalFileName="Reminder-Event"
/>
```
